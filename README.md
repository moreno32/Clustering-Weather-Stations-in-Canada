# Clustering Weather Stations in Canada

## 🔄 Overview:
This project utilizes the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to group weather stations in Canada based on their location and weather patterns. The data was collected from Environment Canada and includes monthly values for July 2015. The project involves data cleaning and visualization, followed by clustering weather stations based on their location and temperature readings (mean, max, and min). The final result showcases the different weather patterns and locations identified through the clustering process.

## 🎊 Motivation:
Weather patterns play a crucial role in various industries, from agriculture to energy production. Understanding these patterns and grouping them based on location can provide valuable insights for decision making. By using DBSCAN clustering, this project aims to identify and visualize the various weather patterns in Canada, helping stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the insights gained.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Data cleaning and preparation
2)	Exploratory data analysis and visualization
3)	Clustering using the DBSCAN algorithm
4)	Visualizing and interpreting the results of clustering

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
The project uses the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to group the weather stations. The algorithm is based on density-based clustering, making it suitable for finding arbitrary shaped clusters. The project also uses popular data science libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, itertools, and pylab.

6)	scikit-learn
7)	Scipy
8)	Itertools
9)	Pylab

## 📚 Data Source:
The data for this project was collected from Environment Canada and includes monthly values for July 2015. The data was loaded using the pandas library and further processed for analysis.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1)	Introduction and about the dataset
2)	Downloading and loading the data
3)	Data cleaning and preparation
